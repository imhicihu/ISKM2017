##Good Practices (proposal)
###Remote Orators
* Verify you are connected to a power electrical supply.
* Fully charge your notebook's battery.
* Verify your time-zone. ISKM2017's official hour is `UTC-03:00`.
* Verify that you are out of malware & virus.
* Test your audio card / webcam.
* Avoid use a VPN connection for streaming.
* Avoid connect through a proxy server.
* Avoid using a wireless connections for streaming.
* Avoid VOIP connections during the streaming.
* Connect through network cable to the fastest connection as possible.
* Test your bandwidth: ie.: [http://beta.speedtest.net/#](http://beta.speedtest.net/#)
* Minimum screen size: 800 x 600 pixels. (VERIFY THIS)
* Defragment your hard disk (where the Mozilla Firefox is installed).
* Verify that your hard disk (where your browser is installed) got -at least- 10 GB of free space available.
* During the streaming, do not enable background operations (defragmentation, antivirus scanning, stream online music [besides the ISKM 2017], avoid pending updates (ie.: Apple App store updates, Microsoft Updates, Linux dependencies alerts, antivirus definitions, _et alia_).
* Shut down instant messaging, email, system notifications (ie.: from operating system, browser itself, social networks, etc.).
* Disable (temporary) any energy saver schema from your operating system during your streaming (ie.: stop hard disk, screen goes black, operating system goes freeze...)
* Disable (temporary) your firewall during the streaming event.
* Disable (temporary) file & screen sharing during the streaming event.
* Disable  (temporary) any disk drive encryption schema:
    - FileVault (MacOSX)
	- Bitlocker (Windows)
	- LUKS (Linux)
* Disable (temporary) remote connections with other computers.
* Disable (temporary) Airplay (on mac computers).
* Disable screensaver.
* Update your Adobe Flash player to the latest version.
* Earlier versions of Adobe Connect than version 9 must be uninstalled.
* Install Adobe Connect Add-in from https://helpx.adobe.com/adobe-connect/connect-downloads-updates.html.
* Verify that you are running the latest version of Mozilla Firefox (preferred browser).
* Run Mozilla Firefox with the essential add-ins (a.k.a: [Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/)) as possible (the less, the better).
* Launch your Mozilla Firefox as `Run as Administrator`
* Clear your `Mozilla's Cached Web Content` before your streaming.
* Run the official Adobe Connect test page: [http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm](http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm).
* Go to: `[https://salvador.adobeconnect.com/](https:https://salvador.adobeconnect.com/)`. Log in with the supplied username and password. (REVIEW THIS  STEP)
* Those remote orators must engage in not change their technical settings (hardware and software) from the pre-rehearsal session to the day of the event. Custom profiles (audio-video) will be created prior to the streaming event by us.
* Essentially, during your remote presentation must be open **only** your browser, your webcam and your microphone.
* Transmit your presentation in a peaceful room. Disable any incoming sound that can comes inside your room (ie: telephone rings, alarms, baby calls, alarm rings, watch alarms, etc.)
* Verify your surround light conditions. Everybody want to see your work.
* Avoid wear horizontal & vertical lines in your clothing. _Reason:_ Prevent the "Moire effect". _Vide_: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61NqgAfAt9Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61NqgAfAt9Y)
* Avoid fluo colors.

* Historical weather data of Buenos Aires on november can be found here: [Precipitaciones mensuales y dias con precipitaciones. Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Enero 1991/diciembre 2017](https://www.estadisticaciudad.gob.ar/eyc/?p=64793) or [Weather Channel Historical data](https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/ARBA0009:1:AR)
* [Downloadable Apps](https://turismo.buenosaires.gob.ar/en/article/downloadable-apps) related with Buenos Aires
* Electric current in Argentina is AC 220-380 volts. Electric plug configurations are 2 or 3 flat pins with the top two slightly angled. Travellers are therefore advised to carry adapters and/or transformers. Check this page: [Plugs of the world](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/list_bylocation.htm)

###Technical data
* Official presentation format: PPT (Microsoft PowerPoint).
* PowerPoint presentation must **not** be password protected.
* Any image, video, music, typography embedded in the presentation (`.ppt`) shouldn't violate any copyright.
* Any typography with non-western typeface (i.e. chinese, japanese, vietnamese) should be sent separately: Not all operating systems render graphica objects in the same way.
* Any video must be sent separately via Organizer's Committee email or WeTransfer.com to avoid digital corruption on the `.ppt` file. (VERIFY THIS)
* Verify that your video can be seen by the media player `VLC` (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). If `positive`, you are out-of-trouble.
* Official graphical data will be online soon.
* Worst technical scenario as possible: installation of TeamViewer or Microsoft Remote Control or Chrome Remote Desktop to fix remotely the orator's computer.
