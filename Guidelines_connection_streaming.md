##Good Practices (proposal)
* install the Adobe Connect Add-in from https://helpx.adobe.com/adobe-connect/connect-downloads-updates.html
* Run the official Adobe Connect test page: [http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm](http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm) from this browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome. Personally I do not pass from Opera & Microsoft Internet Explorer
* Those remote orators must engage in not change their technical settings from the pre-rehearsal session to the day of the event. Custom profiles (audio-video) will be done prior the streaming event.
* Connect directly to the fastest Internet connection available
* Avoid using wireless connections
* Avoid VOIP connections
* Transmit your presentation in a peaceful room
* Avoid connect through a proxy server
* Prior to the event, write in a paper all those passwords that eventually can be useful for you moments before your transmission
* Shut down email, instant messaging, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp messenger, Telegram messenger, system notifications (ie: Operating system, browser itself, etc.)
* Disable screensavers
* Disable remote connections
* Disable Airplay (on mac computers)
* Disable any encryption schema:
     - FileVault (MacOSX)
	 - Bitlocker (Windows)
	 - LUKS (Linux)
* minimun screen size of remote orator: 640 x 480 pixels
* during your transmission, avoid show reflective surfaces and minimal size
* Avoid streaming from this browsers: Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Safari
* Disable any incoming sound that can comes inside your room (ie: telephone rings, alarms, baby calls, alarm rings, watch alarms, etc.)
* Disable computer hibernation (ie: stop hard disk, screen goes black, operating system goes freeze...) during your presentation.
* Generate custom profiles for audio/video settings according every orator
* Essentially, during the streaming event must be open **only** your browser
* The streaming event can not be recorded in any electronic form
* Consider an _In extremis_ solution: installation of TeamViewer or Microsoft Remote Control or Chrome Remote Desktop 


##Miscellaneous
* _Common sense rules everything._
* Evacuation plans
* Insurance policy?
* Medical insurance?
* Consider a great contrast between your color background and the color of your fonts. (ptf file)
* Official presentation format: PPT (Microsoft PowerPoint)
* all the audio/video/sound/graphic embedded in the presentation do not have copyright issues. Or give appropriate credit.
* Any image, video, music, typography enclosed in the presentation shouldn't violate any copyright.
* Any typography with non-western typeface should be sent separately (not all the operating systems render graphica objects in the same way). Or just embed in the presentation.
* Any movie must be sent separately via organizer's committee email or WeTransfer.com to avoid digital corruption on the ppt file.
* Verify that your video can be seen in vlc (videolan.org)
* No electrical supply will be available on room's congress. Fully charge your batteries.
* Historical weather data of Buenos Aires on november can be found here: [Precipitaciones mensuales y d�as con precipitaciones. Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Enero 1991/diciembre 2017](https://www.estadisticaciudad.gob.ar/eyc/?p=64793) or [Weather Channel Historical data](https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/ARBA0009:1:AR)
* [Downloadable Apps](https://turismo.buenosaires.gob.ar/en/article/downloadable-apps) related with Buenos Aires
* Electric current in Argentina is AC 220-380 volts. Electric plug configurations are 2 or 3 flat pins with the top two slightly angled, as in the picture above. Travellers are therefore advised to carry adapters and/or transformers. Check this page: [Plugs of thw world](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/list_bylocation.htm)
* No food. No drinks on rooms.
* Photos without flash can be taken along the meeting.
