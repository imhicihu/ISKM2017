#Discriminate by human actions / hardware-software side
##Good Practices (proposal)
###Orator

##Miscellaneous
* _Common sense rules everything._
* Evacuation plans (maps)?? VERIFY THIS
* Insurance policy? VERIFY THIS
* Medical insurance? VERIFY THIS
* Historical weather data of Buenos Aires on november can be found here: [Precipitaciones mensuales y dias con precipitaciones. Ciudad de Buenos Aires. Enero 1991/diciembre 2017](https://www.estadisticaciudad.gob.ar/eyc/?p=64793) or [Weather Channel Historical data](https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/ARBA0009:1:AR)
* [Downloadable Apps](https://turismo.buenosaires.gob.ar/en/article/downloadable-apps) related with Buenos Aires
* Electric current in Argentina is AC 220-380 volts. Electric plug configurations are 2 or 3 flat pins with the top two slightly angled. Travellers are therefore advised to carry adapters and/or transformers. Check this page: [Plugs of the world](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/list_bylocation.htm)


###Technical data (minutae)
* Official presentation format: PPT (Microsoft PowerPoint)
* PowerPoint presentation must **not** be password protected
* Any image, video, music, typography embedded in the presentation (`.ppt`) shouldn't violate any copyright.
* Any typography with non-western typeface should be sent separately (not all the operating systems render graphica objects in the same way).
* Any video must be sent separately via organizer's committee email or WeTransfer.com to avoid digital corruption on the `.ppt` file.
* Verify that your video can be seen by the media player `VLC` (videolan.org). If `yes`, you are out of trouble.
