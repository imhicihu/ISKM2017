### Good Practices (proposal)
### Remote Speakers
* Foresee a possible power outage: fully charge your notebook's battery / own an [uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply).
* Verify your date and time in your computer is correct.
* Verify your time-zone. ISKM2017's official hour is `UTC-03:00`.
* Verify that you are out of malware & virus.
* Test your audio card / webcam.
* Avoid use a VPN connection for streaming.
* Avoid connect through a proxy server.

* Test your bandwidth: ie.: [http://beta.speedtest.net/#](http://beta.speedtest.net/#)
* Minimum screen size: 800 x 600 pixels. (VERIFY THIS)
* Defragment your hard disk (where Mozilla Firefox® is installed).
* Verify that your hard disk (where your Mozilla Firefox® is installed) got -at least- 10 GB of free space available.
* During the streaming, do not enable background operations (ie.: defragmentation of your hard disk, antivirus scanning, stream online music [besides the ISKM 2017], avoid pending updates (ie.: by Apple App store, by Microsoft; Linux dependencies alerts, antivirus definitions, _et alia_).
* Shut down instant messaging, email, system notifications (ie.: from operating system, browser itself, social networks, etc.).
* Disable (temporarily) any energy saver schema from your operating system during your streaming (ie.: stop hard disk, screen goes black, operating system goes freeze...)
* Disable (temporarily) your firewall during the streaming event.
* Disable (temporarily) file & screen sharing during the streaming event.

    - FileVault (MacOSX)
	- Bitlocker (Windows)
	- LUKS (Linux)
* Disable (temporarily) remote connections with other computers.
* Disable (temporarily) any pop-up blocker software.
* Disable [Mozilla Firefox pop-up blocker](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/pop-blocker-settings-exceptions-troubleshooting#w_pop-up-blocker-settings).
* Disable (temporarily) Airplay or Chromecast.
* Disable any screensaver.
* Update your Adobe Flash player to the latest version. (Check `Mac-Linux-Windows procedures.md`)
* Earlier versions of Adobe Connect than version 9 must be uninstalled.
* Install Adobe Connect Add-in from [https://helpx.adobe.com/adobe-connect/connect-downloads-updates.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/adobe-connect/connect-downloads-updates.html).
* Verify that you are running the latest version of Mozilla Firefox (preferred browser).
* Run Mozilla Firefox with the essential add-ins (a.k.a: [Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/extensions/)) as possible (the less, the better).
* Launch your Mozilla Firefox as `Run as Administrator` if your operating system is Microsoft Windows.
* Clear your [Mozilla's Cached Web Content](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache) before your streaming. Or simply install [Clear cache button](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/empty-cache-button/) extension.
* Run the official Adobe Connect test page: [http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm](http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm). If it warns about installing the Adobe Connect Add-in, install it.
* Go to: [https://salvador.adobeconnect.com/](https:https://salvador.adobeconnect.com/). Login with the supplied username and password.
* Those remote speakers must engage in not change their technical settings (hardware and software) from the pre-rehearsal session to the day of the event. Custom profiles (audio-video) will be created prior to the streaming event by us.
* Essentially, during your remote presentation must be open **only** your browser, your webcam and your microphone.
* Transmit your presentation in a peaceful room. Disable any incoming sound that can comes inside your room (ie: telephone rings, alarms, baby calls, alarm rings, watch alarms, etc.)
* Verify your surround light conditions. Everybody want to see your work.
* Avoid wear horizontal & vertical lines in your clothing. _Reason:_ Prevent the "Moire effect". _Vide_: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61NqgAfAt9Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61NqgAfAt9Y)
* Avoid fluo colors.

* Electric current in Argentina is AC 220-380 volts. Electric plug configurations are 2 or 3 flat pins with the top two slightly angled. Travellers are therefore advised to carry adapters and/or transformers. Check this page: [Plugs of the world](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/list_bylocation.htm)

### Technical data
* Official presentation format: PPT (Microsoft PowerPoint).
* PowerPoint presentation must **not** be password protected.
* Any image, video, music, typography embedded in the presentation (`.ppt`) should not infringe any copyright.
* Any typography with non-western typeface (i.e. chinese, japanese, vietnamese) should be sent separately: Not all operating systems render graphica objects in the same way.
* Any video must be sent separately via Organizer's Committee email or WeTransfer.com to avoid digital corruption on the `.ppt` file.
* Verify that your video can be seen by the media player `VLC` (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). If `positive`, you are out-of-trouble.
* Official graphical data will be online soon.
* Worst technical scenario as possible: installation of TeamViewer or Microsoft Remote Control or Chrome Remote Desktop to fix remotely the orator's computer.
