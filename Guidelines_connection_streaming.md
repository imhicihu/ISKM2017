###Technical data
* Official presentation format: PPT (Microsoft PowerPoint)
* PowerPoint presentation must **not** be password protected
* Any image, video, music, typography embedded in the presentation (`.ppt`) shouldn't violate any copyright.
* Any typography with non-western typeface should be sent separately (not all the operating systems render graphica objects in the same way).
* Any video must be sent separately via organizer's committee email or WeTransfer.com to avoid digital corruption on the `.ppt` file.
* Verify that your video can be seen by the software vlc (videolan.org). If `yes`, you are out of trouble.

* No electrical supply will be available on room's congress. Fully charge your batteries.
