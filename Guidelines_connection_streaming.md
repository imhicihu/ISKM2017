# Discriminate by human actions / hardware-software side

##Good Practices (proposal)
* Fully charge your notebook's battery
* If you are an expositor, verify your surround light conditions. Everybody want to see your face :)
* Verify that you are out of malware & virus
* Test your bandwidth: ie http://beta.speedtest.net/#
* Test your audio card / webcam
* Adobe Flash player updated to the latest version
* Preferred browser: Mozilla Firefox (the latest version, the better)
* Run Mozilla Firefox with the less enabled add-ins as possible
* Clear your Cached Web Content before the streaming event
* Defragment your hard disk (where the Mozilla Firefox is installed)
* During the streaming, do not enable background operations (defragmentation, antivirus scanning, stream online music besides the ISKM 2017, avoid pending updates (ie Microsoft Updates, antivirus definitions, et alia),
* Disable  (temporary) file & screen sharing during the streaming event
* Disable (temporary) your firewall during the streaming event
* Disable  (temporary) any disk drive encryption schema
* Avoid log in or use a VPN connection along the streaming event. You will be kicked up
* Avoid open a "New Private Window" (Firefox) / "New Incognito windows" (Chrome) to access the streaming event. You will be kicked up.
* Launch your browser as Run as Administrator
* Verify your time-zone against the streaming event
* install Adobe Connect Add-in from https://helpx.adobe.com/adobe-connect/connect-downloads-updates.html
* Run the official Adobe Connect test page: [http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm](http://admin.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm) from this browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome. Personally I do not pass from Opera & Microsoft Internet Explorer
* Those remote orators must engage in not change their technical settings from the pre-rehearsal session to the day of the event. Custom profiles (audio-video) will be done prior the streaming event.
* Connect directly to the fastest Internet connection available
* Avoid using wireless connections
* Avoid VOIP connections
* Transmit your presentation in a peaceful room
* Avoid connect through a proxy server
* Prior to the event, write in a paper all those passwords that eventually can be useful for you moments before your transmission
* Shut down email, instant messaging, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp messenger, Telegram messenger, system notifications (ie: Operating system, browser itself, etc.)
* Disable screensavers
* Disable remote connections
* Disable Airplay (on mac computers)
* Disable any encryption schema:
     - FileVault (MacOSX)
	 - Bitlocker (Windows)
	 - LUKS (Linux)
* minimun screen size of remote orator: 640 x 480 pixels
* during your transmission, avoid show reflective surfaces and minimal size
* Avoid streaming from this browsers: Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Safari
* Disable any incoming sound that can comes inside your room (ie: telephone rings, alarms, baby calls, alarm rings, watch alarms, etc.)
* Disable computer hibernation (ie: stop hard disk, screen goes black, operating system goes freeze...) during your presentation.
* Generate custom profiles for audio/video settings according every orator
* Essentially, during the streaming event must be open **only** your browser
* The streaming event can not be recorded in any electronic form
* Consider an _In extremis_ solution: installation of TeamViewer or Microsoft Remote Control or Chrome Remote Desktop 


##Miscellaneous
* _Common sense rules everything._
* Evacuation plans

* Consider a great contrast between your color background and the color of your fonts. (ptf file)
* Official presentation format: PPT (Microsoft PowerPoint)
* PowerPoint presentation must **not** be password protected
* all the audio/video/sound/graphic embedded in the presentation do not have copyright issues. Or give appropriate credit.
* Any image, video, music, typography enclosed in the presentation shouldn't violate any copyright.
* Any typography with non-western typeface should be sent separately (not all the operating systems render graphica objects in the same way). Or just embed in the presentation.
* Any movie must be sent separately via organizer's committee email or WeTransfer.com to avoid digital corruption on the ppt file.
