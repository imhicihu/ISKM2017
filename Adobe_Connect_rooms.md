## Control access when creating new rooms
* When creating a new meeting in Adobe Connect, you can control access by determining the access options, setting a password, and/or explicitly inviting participants to your meeting.

* _Option 1:_ Only registered users may enter the room (**guest access is blocked**)
     - With this option, all participants are required to login using their ISKM2017 login credentials. This is the most secure method and the only way to ensure access is restricted to just registered users.

* _Option 2:_ Only registered users and accepted guests may enter the room.
     - With this option "Guests" must be accepted before they can enter.

* _Option 3:_ Anyone who has the URL for the meeting can enter the room.
